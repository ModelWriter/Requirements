Requirements
============

*User Requirements Document (URD)* and *Software Requirements Document (SRD)*


A common User Requirements Document (URD) (D1.7.1) will be compiled from the catalogues of Industrial Use Case partners, resulting in a common list of formal requirements with initial prioritization, taking into account both national priorities and international commonalities / synergies.

A common Software Requirements Document (SRD) (D1.9.1) derived from the previous URD will identify and prioritize the functional and non-functional requirements for the ModelWriter IDE, addressing the selected User Requirements.
